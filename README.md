## Installation

## How It Works
When you write a journal entry, the app sends it to GPT-4 with a prompt to generate:

- A poetic emotional description

- A hex color code representing your aura

It then calculates a softer version of the color for gradients and displays it in a radial "aura" on the calendar. Multiple auras are blended in the Monthly Aura Summary using a canvas-based particle animation.




##  Inspiration
Aura Farming was built during a July 2025 hackathon to explore how AI can help people cultivate emotional awareness and gratitude through creative, sensory-based interaction.
